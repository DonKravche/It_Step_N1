# Palindrome Checker and ASCII Converter

This project contains two Python programs that perform text manipulation tasks.

## Task 1: Palindrome Checker

This program checks if a given input text is a palindrome.

### Features:
- Prompts the user to enter a text
- Checks if the entered text is a palindrome
- Prints the result: whether the text is a palindrome or not

### What is a palindrome?
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## Task 2: ASCII Converter

This program converts input text to its corresponding ASCII values.

### Features:
- Prompts the user to enter a text
- Converts each character of the input text to its ASCII value
- Prints the sequence of ASCII values

## How to Use

1. Run the desired program (palindrome checker or ASCII converter).
2. Enter the text when prompted.
3. The program will display the result based on the specific task.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Note

Make sure to input the text in the same language as the program prompts (Georgian in this case).

Would you like me to provide sample code implementations for these tasks?
