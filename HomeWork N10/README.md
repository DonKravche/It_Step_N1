# Python Search and Sort Algorithms

This project implements various search and sort algorithms in Python, along with some functional programming concepts.

## Task 1: Random List Generation, Search, and Sort

### 1. Random List Generation
Implement a Python function that generates a list filled with 100 randomly chosen numbers.

### 2. Linear Search
Write a function that uses linear search to find a specific element in the given list.

### 3. Sorting and Binary Search
Use a sorting algorithm of your choice to sort the list, then implement binary search to find an element in the sorted list.

## Task 2: Lambda Functions and List Processing

### 1. Lambda Function for Multiples of Three
Write a lambda function that returns numbers that are multiples of three.

### 2. List Processing Function
Implement a function that takes a list and a lambda function as arguments. Using linear search and the lambda function, create a new list containing the indices of elements that satisfy the lambda function's condition. Return this new list.

(The function should return a list containing the indices of numbers that are multiples of three in the original list.)

## Implementation Details

The code for Task 1 is implemented in the `binary_function()`. It includes:
- Random list generation
- Linear search
- Bubble sort
- Binary search

The code prints the original random list, the result of linear search, the sorted list, and the result of binary search.

Task 2 is not implemented in the provided code but should be added as separate functions.

## Usage

Run the Python script to execute the `binary_function()` which demonstrates the functionality for Task 1.
