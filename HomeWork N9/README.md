# Programming Tasks README

## Task 1: Sorting Lists

Write a function that generates a list of 100 randomly generated elements. Use the `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function to return the sorted list in ascending and then descending order.

## Task 2: Sorting Algorithms

Write a function that generates a list of 100 randomly generated elements. Use two different sorting algorithms (it does not matter which ones) to sort the list in ascending and descending order. Print both results to the terminal.

## Task 3: Population Growth

1. Write a function that calculates how many years it will take for the population to exceed 10,000 people, given an annual growth rate of 2%.
   
2. Write a function that takes the number of years as an attribute and returns the population count after that many years.

## Task 4: List Comparison

Write a function that takes two lists of integers as attributes. Compare the elements at the same positions in both lists and return a new list with the higher numbers from the comparison. Include logical exception handling.

## Task 5: Triangle Formation

Write a function that takes three numbers as attributes and returns whether it is possible to form a triangle with those three sides. The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

## Task 6: Student Grades

Write a function that takes a list of students in the following format:

```python
student_list = [
    '1 - Melissa Parker - 91 60 89 84 26',
    '2 - Paige Simon - 39 90 38 74 49',
    '3 - Kevin Atkins - 27 7 89 96 62',
    '4 - Barry Ramos - 94 93 62 30 66',
    '5 - Karen Hudson - 51 15 94 20 8',
    '6 - Jennifer Diaz - 56 31 81 52 50',
    '7 - Robin Smith - 90 3 92 86 14',
    '8 - Kevin Clark - 69 65 47 58 44',
    '9 - Lisa Shields DDS - 92 1 53 40 89',
    '10 - John Kennedy - 21 41 12 15 90',
]
```

Calculate the average score for each student and return a list in the format:

```python
[[name, avg], [name, avg], â€¦]
```

## Task 7: Digit Count

Write a function that takes a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [9255, 1358, 1045285, 59828218, 881525, 388, 8586, 9988, 599828, 812358, 855, 85585, 85885, 888]
```

Return a new list containing numbers where:
- The number contains both digits 5 and 8.
- The count of digit 8 is greater than the count of digit 5.
