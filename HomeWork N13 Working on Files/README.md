# File Manipulation Tasks in Python

This project contains three Python tasks that focus on file manipulation. Each task demonstrates different aspects of working with text files using Python.

## Task 1: Create and Read a Numbered File

Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a text file
2. Writes 1000 lines to the file (the content of the lines is not important)
3. Numbers each line
4. Reads the file
5. Prints the number of lines that have been filled

## Task 2: Create a File with Specific Numbered Lines

Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a text file
2. Writes the ordinal numbers (in words) for 2nd, 8th, 10th, 13th, and 17th lines
3. The rest of the lines should contain their respective numbers

## Task 3: Merge Two Files

Write a Python program that:
1. Reads two separate text files
2. Merges the content of these two files into a new text file
3. Reads the merged file
4. Prints the content of the merged file to the terminal

## Getting Started

To run these tasks, you need Python installed on your system. Each task should be implemented as a separate Python script.

## Note

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create, read, and write files in your working directory. Also, make sure to handle potential exceptions that may occur during file operations.
