# Banking and Student Management System

This project implements two main classes: `BankAccount` for a basic banking system and `Student` for managing student information and course enrollments.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Bank Account System

Implement a basic banking system with the following features:

- Create a `BankAccount` class with attributes:
  - `account_number`
  - `account_holder`
  - `balance`
- Implement methods for:
  - Depositing money
  - Withdrawing money
- Create multiple `BankAccount` objects
- Perform several transactions

### Task 2: Student Management System

Implement a student management system with the following features:

- Create a `Student` class with attributes:
  - `name`
  - `student_id`
  - `courses` (a list of courses the student is enrolled in)
- Implement methods for:
  - Displaying student information
  - Showing enrolled courses
- Create multiple `Student` objects
- Register students for various courses

## Implementation

The project should be implemented in Python, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles.

## Usage

Provide examples of how to create objects and use the methods for both `BankAccount` and `Student` classes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Implement the `BankAccount` and `Student` classes in separate Python files
3. Create a main script to demonstrate the functionality of both classes

## Testing

Create test cases to verify the correct functionality of all methods in both classes.
