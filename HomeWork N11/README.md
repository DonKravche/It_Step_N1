# Python Set and Tuple Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises focusing on Python sets and tuples. Each exercise is designed to help you practice different aspects of working with these data structures.

## Exercises

1. Squared Numbers
Create a variable `squared_numbers` containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Do not fill it manually.

### 2. String to Set
Write a function that takes a string as an attribute and returns a set containing each unique character in the string.

### 3. Combine Tuples
Write a function that takes two tuples as attributes. The function should combine these tuples and return a single tuple without duplicates. Create a list `duplicated_values` and add to it (only once) the information that appears in duplicate form in the tuples. Print this list.

Example:
```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
tuple2 = (4,5,5,6,6,7)

Output:
combined_tuple: (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
duplicated_values: [4,5,6]
```

### 4. Swap Tuple Elements
Write a function that takes a tuple as an attribute and returns a new tuple where the first and last elements have swapped places.

Example:
```python
Input: (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: (4, 2, 3, 1)
```

### 5. Flatten Nested Tuple
Write a function that takes a nested tuple as an attribute and returns a single flattened tuple containing all elements.

Example:
```python
Input: (1, (2, 3), (4, (5, 6)))
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### 6. Cartesian Product of Sets
Write a function that takes two sets as attributes and returns a set of tuples containing all possible pairs from these two sets.

Example:
```python
Input: {1, 2} {'a', 'b'}
Output: {(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b')}
```
