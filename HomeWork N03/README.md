# Python Programming Tasks

This repository contains three Python programming tasks designed for beginners to practice using `while` loops, conditionals, and basic input/output operations.

## Task 1: Reverse Countdown

Write a Python program that takes a number from the user and then uses a `while` loop to print the numbers in reverse order down to 0. For example, if the user inputs the number 4, the program should print: 4, 3, 2, 1.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to input a number.
2. Use a `while` loop to print the numbers in reverse order until 0 is reached.

## Task 2: Sum of Positive Numbers

Write a Python program that continuously takes numbers from the user. Create an initial variable `total_sum = 0`. Check each number, and if it is positive, add it to `total_sum`. This process continues until the user inputs the text "sum", at which point the program should print the sum of all positive numbers entered.

### Instructions:
1. Create a variable `total_sum` and set it to 0.
2. Continuously prompt the user to input a number or the text "sum".
3. If the input is "sum", print the total sum and break the loop.
4. If the input is a positive number, add it to `total_sum`.
5. If the input is not positive, prompt the user to enter a positive number.

## Task 3: Guess the Random Number (Optional)

Write a Python program that randomly selects a number within any specified range. Also, choose a number of lives to be stored in a variable. The program should prompt the user to guess the number until they either guess correctly or run out of lives. If the guessed number is higher than the random number, print a message indicating it's too high. If it's lower, print a message indicating it's too low. The program should stop after a win or a loss.

### Instructions:
1. Generate a random number within a specified range.
2. Set the number of lives.
3. Continuously prompt the user to guess the number.
4. If the guessed number is correct, print a winning message and break the loop.
5. If the guessed number is incorrect, decrement the number of lives and print a message indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
6. If the user runs out of lives, print a losing message and break the loop.

These tasks will help you understand basic loops, conditionals, and user input in Python. Happy coding!
