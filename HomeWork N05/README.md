# Python Programming Tasks

This repository contains a set of Python programming tasks focusing on list manipulation, matrix operations, and list comprehension.

## Tasks

### 1. Sum of Specific List Elements
- Given a list `mylist`, sum the 3rd, 9th, and 14th elements.
- Print the result.

### 2. Random List and Odd Numbers
- Create a list of 20 random numbers.
- Create a new list containing only the odd numbers from the first list.
- Print the smallest and largest elements of the new list without using `min()` and `max()` functions.

### 3. List Manipulation
- Create a list `my_llist = [43, '22', 12, 66, 210, ["hi"]]`.
- Print the index of 210.
- Add "hello" to the last element.
- Remove the element at index 2 and print the list.
- Create a copy of the list, clear it, and print both lists.

### 4. Matrix Addition
- Write a program to add two matrices.
- The matrices should have the same dimensions.
- Sum corresponding elements.

### 5. Matrix Transposition
- Write a program to transpose a 3x3 square matrix.
- Transposition means swapping indices (e.g., `list[2][3]` becomes `list[3][2]`).

### 6. Random Matrix with List Comprehension
- Use list comprehension to create a 4x4 square matrix of random numbers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Each task is a separate Python file.
3. Run each file to see the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Note

Make sure to implement the tasks without using built-in functions where specified (e.g., not using `min()` and `max()` in Task 2).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the tasks.
