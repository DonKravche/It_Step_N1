# Python Dictionary Exercises

This repository contains solutions to five Python exercises focusing on dictionaries and related concepts.

## Task 1: Word Frequency Counter

Write a Python program that asks the user to input a sentence, then prints a dictionary showing how many times each word is used in the sentence.

Example:
- Input: "The wind howled and howled all night long"
- Output: {"the": 1, "wind":1, "howled":2, "and":1, "all":1, "night":1, "long":1}

## Task 2: Simple Calculator

Create a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operator. Build a calculator that performs the corresponding operation. Use dictionaries where the keys are mathematical operators.

## Task 3: Square Number Dictionary

Using dictionary comprehension, generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive), and the values are their squares.

## Task 4: Company Department Information

Create a dictionary that stores information about departments and employees. Each employee should have attributes: first name, last name, age, and salary. Calculate the average salary for each department.

## Task 5: Dictionary Key-Value Swap

Write a function that takes a dictionary as an argument. The function should return a new dictionary where the keys are the original dictionary's values, and the values are the original dictionary's keys.

## How to Use

Each task is implemented in a separate Python file. To run a specific task, use the following command:

```
python task_number.py
```

Replace `task_number` with the number of the task you want to run (e.g., `task1.py`, `task2.py`, etc.).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
