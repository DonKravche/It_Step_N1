# File Handling and Book Management System

This project consists of four Python tasks focusing on file handling and a simple book management system.

## Task 1: Palindrome Lines

Write a function that reads a file and prints the lines that are palindromes of each other.

## Task 2: File Splitting

Create a Python function that takes a filename as an attribute, reads the file, splits the lines based on quantity, and writes them into new files with a maximum of 10 lines each.

## Task 3: Remove Empty Lines

Develop a Python function that accepts two filenames as attributes. It should read the first file, remove empty lines, and write the complete information to the second file.

## Task 4: Book Management System

Implement a Python application that initially writes the following information to a CSV file:

```python
[
    {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949},
    {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "year": 1960},
    {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "year": 1925},
    {"title": "Moby Dick", "author": "Herman Melville", "year": 1851},
    {"title": "Pride and Prejudice", "author": "Jane Austen", "year": 1813},
    {"title": "War and Peace", "author": "Leo Tolstoy", "year": 1869},
    {"title": "Ulysses", "author": "James Joyce", "year": 1922},
    {"title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "author": "J.D. Salinger", "year": 1951},
    {"title": "The Hobbit", "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien", "year": 1937},
    {"title": "Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley", "year": 1932}
]
```

### Features:

1. Define functions for reading book information and adding new information.
2. Prompt the user to input whether they want to read or write information.
3. If reading, ask for a title and retrieve information based on that title.
4. Describe each logical operation as a function and call them accordingly.

## Usage

Run the Python script and follow the prompts to interact with the book management system. You can choose to read existing book information or add new books to the system.

## Note

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where you run these scripts.
