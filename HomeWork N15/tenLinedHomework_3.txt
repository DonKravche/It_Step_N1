Pigeons coo and peck at crumbs on sidewalks.
Street vendors set up their colorful stalls.







A deified leader's statue stands in the square.
The day marches on, full of activity.
Students hurry to their classes.
A tenet of good education is being discussed.


Life goes on, a tapestry of moments.
The city pulses with energy and life.






As evening approaches, the pace slows.
Another day comes to an end, like a palindrome.
