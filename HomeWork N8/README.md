# Python Assignments

This repository contains four Python assignments focusing on lambda functions, list manipulation, and the use of built-in functions.

## Assignment 1: Grouping Lists with zip Function

Write a Python function that takes lists of the same size as parameters and uses the zip function to group the elements of the lists together.

**Example:**
- Input: `[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']`
- Output: `["(1, 'a')", "(2, 'b')", "(3, 'c')"]`

## Assignment 2: Filtering Even Elements

Write a lambda function that takes a list and returns only the even elements of the list.

**Example:**
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- Output: `[2, 4, 6]`

## Assignment 3: Filtering Positive Numbers

Write a lambda function that returns only the positive values of numbers. The numbers to be checked should be described in a list. Use the filter function from the functools module.

## Assignment 4: Checking for Palindromes

Write a lambda function that checks whether a string is a palindrome or not. The strings should be stored in a list. Use the filter function.

## Usage

Create a separate Python file for each assignment. Run each file in the terminal with the following command:



where `filename.py` is the name of the file for the respective assignment.

## Note

All assignments should be completed using Python's standard library, except where specifically instructed to use additional modules.
