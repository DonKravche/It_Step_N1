# Python Practice Assignments

This repository contains seven Python assignments covering various programming concepts including functions, global variables, lists, strings, and recursion.

## Assignments

### 1. Modifying a Global List

Create a global variable `int_list = [10,20,30,40]` and write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and adds it to the global `int_list`.

### 2. Finding the Longest Word

Write a function that takes a sentence as an attribute and returns the longest word in the sentence.
Hint: You can use the string method split().

### 3. Sum of a List of Numbers

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of the numbers.
The function should accept the following list as a parameter: [100,20,30,50,5323,3321,22,56,700,90,10]

### 4. Finding Unique Values

Write a function that takes a list as an attribute and returns a new list containing only the values that are unique (used only once) in the input list.

### 5. Sum of Digits Using Recursion

Using recursion, write a Python function that takes one parameter 'number' and returns the sum of its digits. (For example, if the function receives the number 12345, it should return 15, because 1+2+3+4+5 equals 15)

### 6. Reversing a String Using Recursion

Using recursion, write a Python function that takes a string as a parameter and returns its reversed string. (For example, input: "Hello", Output: "olleH")

### 7. Factorial Using Recursion

Using recursion, write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and returns the factorial of that number.

## Usage

Each assignment is contained in its own Python file. To run an assignment, navigate to its file and execute it using Python.
